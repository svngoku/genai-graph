"""Prefect flow + workflow-engine step for summarizing a Document Graph.

Wraps `genai_graph.kg.document_graph.summarize.summarize_graph` so it can be
referenced by dotted path from a genai-tk workflow YAML (`run:` / `uses:`),
exactly like `document_graph_flow` or `kg_create_step`.

Concurrency model
-----------------
Documents are summarized concurrently across ``workers`` threads that share a
single Ladybug ``Database`` (each thread its own ``Connection``) — see
``genai_graph.kg.parallel.SharedKuzuParallel``. Ladybug is embedded: only one
read-write ``Database`` may exist per file in a process, but multiple
``Connection``s from that one ``Database`` issue concurrent read and write
transactions safely as long as they touch disjoint rows, which per-document
summarization does (each ``markdown_hash`` is summarized exactly once). This
stays a single Prefect task with internal thread parallelism, not a fan-out of
per-document Prefect tasks (those would each open their own ``Database`` and
race). The Ladybug REST API server is only needed for multi-*process* access,
which is not the case here.

    Args:
        db_path: Path to the (already built) Ladybug Document Graph database.
        folder_id: When given, only summarize documents under this folder's subtree.
        llm: LLM id (`name@provider`) or config tag. Uses `kg_build.llms.default` when omitted.
        max_level: Deepest heading level that gets a description.
        summary_min_tokens: Sections at or above this token count also get a paragraph summary.
        llm_max_tokens: Explicit max output tokens for the LLM call. Raise this if you see
            'length limit reached' errors — a reasoning model spent its whole completion
            budget on hidden reasoning tokens, not the input context window.
        force: Re-summarize documents that already have a `summary`.
        dry_run: Compute the plan (selection, batching, warnings) without calling the
            LLM or writing to the graph.
        workers: Number of documents summarized in parallel (shared-DB thread pool).
